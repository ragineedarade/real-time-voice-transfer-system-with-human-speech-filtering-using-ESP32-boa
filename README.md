Approach for Real-Time Voice Transfer System with Human Speech Filter using ESP32
1. Hardware Setup:
ESP32 Boards: Use two ESP32 boards; one for capturing and processing audio (Transmitter) and the other for receiving and playing audio (Receiver).
Microphones: Connect two microphones to the first ESP32 (Transmitter) to capture audio.
Speaker: Connect a speaker to the second ESP32 (Receiver) to output audio.
2. Software Configuration:
Arduino IDE Setup: Install Arduino IDE and add the ESP32 board support package.
Library Installation: Install necessary libraries like BluetoothSerial for Bluetooth communication and I2S for audio data handling.
3. Bluetooth Communication:
Pairing: Establish Bluetooth communication between the two ESP32 boards for data transfer.
4. Audio Data Capture and Processing:
Microphone Input: Use I2S protocol to read audio data from the microphones.
Filtering: Implement a filter to detect and isolate human speech from other noises using FFT or thresholding methods.
5. Data Transmission:
Send Processed Audio: Transmit the filtered audio data from the Transmitter ESP32 to the Receiver ESP32 using Bluetooth.
6. Audio Output:
Receive and Play Audio: The Receiver ESP32 receives the audio data and uses I2S to output it through the connected speaker.
7. Optimization:
Latency Minimization: Optimize the Bluetooth communication and I2S data handling to minimize latency for real-time performance.
Filter Tuning: Adjust the filtering parameters to ensure accurate detection and transmission of human speech.
Summary:
Setup Hardware: Connect microphones and speaker to respective ESP32 boards.
Configure Software: Set up Arduino IDE, install libraries, and write code for Bluetooth communication and audio processing.
Implement Bluetooth Communication: Pair the ESP32 boards and establish a data transfer link.
Capture and Filter Audio: Read audio data using I2S, apply filtering to isolate human speech.
Transmit and Output Audio: Send the filtered audio data via Bluetooth, receive it on the second ESP32, and output through the speaker.
Optimize Performance: Minimize latency and fine-tune the filter for better speech detection.
